## 🎯 Color Consistency

### **Before:**
Each product had its own color scheme:
- SIMAURA: Blue (#3b82f6)
- MENBITA: Purple (#8b5cf6)
- FINCORP: Green (#10b981)
- EDULEASE: Orange (#f59e0b)

Buttons would change color based on which product page you were viewing.

### **After:**
All buttons and interactive elements now use:
- **Primary Blue: `#3b82f6`**
- **Hover Blue: `#2563eb`** (darker shade)
- **Shadow: `rgba(59, 130, 246, 0.4)`**

This creates a **consistent brand experience** across all product pages!

## 📋 Elements Still Using Product Colors

The following elements **still use product-specific colors** for visual variety:

✅ **Category Badges** - Each product keeps its unique badge color
✅ **Gradient Orbs** (background decorations) - Subtle product-colored accents
✅ **Featured Image Backgrounds** - Light gradient overlays
✅ **Icon Backgrounds** (on cards) - Subtle product color tints
✅ **Related Product Cards** - Keep their individual colors

This approach maintains **visual interest** while ensuring **brand consistency** for all CTAs and interactive elements.
